URGENT: LOGIN PAGE STUCK ON LOADER - FIX INSTRUCTIONS
====================================================

The fix is ready! Follow these steps ON YOUR WINDOWS MACHINE (F:\Web\billing):

1. PULL THE LATEST CHANGES:
   git pull origin claude/fix-login-page-loader-fHR9T

2. REBUILD FRONTEND ASSETS:
   npm run dev

   (Wait for "Compiled Successfully" message)

3. CLEAR BROWSER CACHE:
   - Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+Delete → Check "Cached images and files" → Clear
   - Or just hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R

4. REFRESH THE PAGE:
   - The login page should appear within 2 seconds
   - Check browser console (F12) for any errors

WHAT WAS FIXED:
- Added 2-second timeout to force loader dismissal
- Restructured app initialization to mount Vue app first
- Added error handling for all API calls
- Loader will ALWAYS dismiss, even if backend is down

IF STILL NOT WORKING:
- Open browser console (F12)
- Share any red error messages you see
- The console should show "Bootstrap timeout - forcing loader dismissal" after 2 seconds
